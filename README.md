# spaceinvaders
Mock Space Invaders video game using Python. It resembles the basic, original game, and has enemies, a main player, an in-game score system, and working physics. There are separate colors for enemies, the player and bullets, but that is the only artistic components in the game. I also have a score chart in the game.
